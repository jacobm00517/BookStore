# BookStore

This Java-based web application implements a searchable online bookstore using the DAO design pattern, MVC architecture, and an embedded SQLite database. Users can view all books, filter by category, or search by keyword.

## Features

- Uses DAO & MVC Patterns
- View all available books in the store
- Filter books by category (e.g., Java, Groovy)
- Keyword search (e.g., search by author or title)
- Clean separation of concerns via DAO and MVC design patterns
- JSTL and Expression Language (EL) used for dynamic content rendering
- RESTful interaction with a SQLite database (no server setup required)

## Tech Stack

- **Java Servlet API**
- **SQLite**
- **JSP**
- **HTML / CSS / JS**
- **Apache Tomcat (for deployment)**

## Setup & Deployment

1. Import the WAR file into Eclipse or your preferred IDE.
2. Deploy the WAR file to a local server (e.g., Apache Tomcat).
3. Open the web app in your browser and test the search and filter features.
